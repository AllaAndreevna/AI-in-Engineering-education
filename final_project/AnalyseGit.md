This is our final exam project "Code evaluation system in GIT repositories".

5 people participated in the project. I was developing a chat, as well as a task assignment system (highlighting the author of the part of the code where there is an error).

The final version - https://github.com/Serovvans/GitMetrics
Developing version with future features (spoilers) - https://github.com/Serovvans/AnalyseGit
